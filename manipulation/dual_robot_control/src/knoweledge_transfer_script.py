    ARM MOVEMENT COMMANDS
    0. Syntax
        We specify a command for arm movement like so:
            status = robot_control.[]
        - status is the return from a movement, which specifies the execution result and any system log messages
        - robot_control is the movement commander defined earlier
        - [] is where we specify the movement command, outlined below
    1. Move arm by providing a joint goal specified by a list of joint angles
        Useful for when moving arm to a specific position. 
        Simply supply a list of joint angles (easily found in RViz) to the command, like so:
            joint_goal = [...]
            status = robot_control.move_to_joint_goal(ARM_NAME, [x * np.pi / 180 for x in joint_goal])
        Bit of math is necessary to convert joint angles to quaternions usable by the movement commanding function.
    2. Move arm to predefined pose
        Some poses are predefined and can be navigated to by simply referring to its name.
        For the arms, these are 'sleep' and 'ready'.
        For the gripper, these are 'open' and 'close'.
        More can be added and defined, however this process is lost to me as it was done by Ian. I believe you need the MoveIt wizard. (another good undergad task?)
        Execute like so:
            status = robot_control.move_to_target(arm, 'sleep')
            status = robot_control.set_gripper(arm, "open")
    3. Move arm to a target frame
        The gripper's frame (a/b_ee_arm_link) can be maneuvered such that it matches that of a frame in the world. 
        This is crux of my work and how I primarily moved the arm: essentially defining and moving a frame around the world
        and sending the arm to it using the following command:
            status = robot_control.move_to_frame(ARM_NAME, "frame_name")
        Simply specify the arm you'd like to move followed by a string containing the name of the frame. This then tasks
        the motion planner to position the gripper end effector frame exactly where the frame is. This worked for my
        research as it was applicable to simple pick/place tasks, but this approach lacks definition of the rest of the arm. The
        motion planners we use are undeterministic (see probablistic roadmap motion planners), meaning every (including repeated)
        trajectories to the same target pose may vary, so keep this in mind when using this approach and navigating around obstacles,
        wanting the arm to move a certain way, etc.

    # Example of 1: Movement by joint goal

    # Example of 2: Movement by predefined pose
    status = robot_control.move_to_target(SEARCHING_ARM, 'sleep')
    status = robot_control.set_gripper(SEARCHING_ARM, "open")
